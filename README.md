# AndroidAppViewer
Android GLES3 stub with optional remote imgui rendering

![Image of dear imgui](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/AndroidAppViewer/blob/master/remoteImgui.jpg)

master branch is a simple example with a GLES3 context, path traced cube and on top on a SurfaceView instead of a GLSurfaceView in case you handle your context more seriously.

remoteImgui branch is the same sample with remote imgui.
Based on Jordi Ros Remote Imgui https://github.com/JordiRos/remoteimgui 
updated to use the latest dear imgui version (v1.67 WIP)
